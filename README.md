This is my portfolio project created using HTML and a bit of basic CSS

I uploaded it since it was part of the assignment required in the Udemy web dev course
 
Some files like solution.html, birthday-invite.html, and movie-ranking.html belong to the instructor.

Also, pictures such as goal.png, birthday-invite.png, and movie-ranking.png is the instructor's final goal of what is to be achieved once done with the project.
